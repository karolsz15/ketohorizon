      what_is_keto: {
        title: 'What Is the Ketogenic Diet?',
        content: 'The keto diet focuses on reducing your intake of carbs and increasing fats. Typically, your body uses glucose (from carbs) as its main source of energy. On keto, when carbs are drastically reduced, your body enters a state called ketosis, where it starts burning fat for fuel instead.'

      how_ketosis_works: {
        title: 'How Does Ketosis Work?',
        content: 'When you eat very few carbs, your liver begins converting fat into molecules called ketones, which your body and brain can use for energy. This shift can help people lose weight, improve mental focus, and maintain steady energy without sugar crashes.'
